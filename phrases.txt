Bit like me in that sense
History is written by the winners
With age comes wisdom
The early bird catches the worm

You don’t need it, you just want to
I am a number one
Man I look good
You snooze you lose
Do not be the input or the output, but the process
Quiet down please
Where others see travesty, I see business
I’m on Fire
No matter how strong the fire burns it will always go out.

Others see potatoes, I see potential
Words cant be strong...
Don't worry I forgive you.
Not good enough.
Literally 1985.

Dont mock science
Too much yang
As they say in the midlands
Comme les personnes francais le mettent

Joe mama (laughs)
Each to their own
I'm marking my territory
Guys please stop messing around
I licked my hips at the sexy lips of husband number five
Hello sir
When presented with all the carbonara, eat all the carbonara
Time to get a watch
