I am a man of integrity
Bit like me in that sense
History is written by the winners
With age comes wisdom
The early bird catches the worm
The world is mean
At the end of the day I am always right
I would like to sample the best of the best
You don’t need it, you just want to
Man I look good
Do not be the input or the output, but the process
Quiet down please
Where others see travesty, see business
I’m on Fire
No matter how strong the fire burns it will always go out.
Why have one quote when you can have two?
I’m only Human
Please keep the noise down
I knead it you want it™
You cant have everything you want in life
Please dont swear
Actually...
Jealous?
I dont shut up I grow up and when I see you I throw up
Please don't use the Lord's name in vain
Well if you love it so much why dont you marry it?
Hate is a strong word
Go off queen
You are what you say
Others see potatoes, I see potential
Words cant be strong...
Don't worry I forgive you.
Not good enough.
Literally 1984.
Im a curious george.
Dont mock science
Too much yang
As they say in the midlands
Comme les personnes francais le mettent
I don't know can you?
Joe mama (laughs)
Each to their own
I'm marking my territory
Guys please stop messing around
I licked my hips at the sexy lips of husband number five
Hello sir
When presented with all the carbonara, eat all the carbonara
Time to get a watch
I'm making places
Zero problems
Skills to pay the bills
